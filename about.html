                A short introduction about me, I am Abdul-Wasey Khan, a student and tech enthusiast. 
                I spend my free time learning new tech, and I am often busy with my school work. 
                My favorite coding language/tool is Java, because of Java's data type safety and security features. 
                I am very passionate about ML and AI. 
                I have started studying ML and AI however, due to limited time, my ML and AI self-study is only limited to winter break. I spend my summer time taking courses at school. 
                I love learning different features of different programming languages. 
                I like drawing birds, and I like playing cricket. 
                I have a great interest in back-end development. 
                However, lately, I have been quite interested in full-stack web development. 
                After taking a full-stack web development course at school, I have grown an interest in full-stack development. I am currently practicing my front-end skills and learning cloud-based deployment. 
                It will not be fair if I don't talk about databases when we are talking about full-stack. 
                I am very passionate about database security and I always ensure my database model provides fast data access. If you are currently hiring a junior web developer please review my resume and send me an email. 
                I am currently open to new opportunities.
